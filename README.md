### Introduction 
Employee attrition refers to an employee’s voluntary or involuntary resignation from a workforce. Organizations spend many resources in hiring talented employees and training them. Every employee is critical to a company’s success. Our goal was to predict employee attrition and identify the factors contributing to an employee leaving a workforce. 
In this project, I have developed a Machine Learning Model to predict the Employee Attrition by implementing various Machine Learning Algorithms. Conducted exploratory data analysis using various data visualization techniques.
